          NSU Problem Solvers (NSUPS) is a problem-solving community based on North South University. This community's primary purpose is to help beginner students get involved in competitive programming through a 2-semester long training session called 'Bootcamp', advanced training sessions and programming contests, etc. Hence, I got involved with this community at the beginning of my undergraduate life and had the opportunity to participate in several programming competitions organized by NSUPS.
